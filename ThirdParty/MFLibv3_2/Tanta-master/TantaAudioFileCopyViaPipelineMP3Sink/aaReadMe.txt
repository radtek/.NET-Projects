#### The TantaAudioFileCopyViaPipelineMP3Sink Project
####

This project creates a copy of an mp3 audio file. It does this by
using a WMF Media Session, Pipeline, Media Source and MP3 Media Sink.

The intent is to demonstrate the end-to-end operation of a pipeline
with a single media stream.

The MP3 Media Sink is used as the file sink in this example.
