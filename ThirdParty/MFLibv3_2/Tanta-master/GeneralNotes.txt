The Tanta Sample Projects seek to provide simple (well, as simple as it can get) C# examples of
how to use Windows Media Foundation. These samples are open source, released under the MIT license
and available for download from http://www.GitHub.com/OfItselfSo/Tanta

WMF is a Windows C++/COM technology and, although there is no Microsoft provided C# interface,
there is a superb open source access library called MF.Net. (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mfnet)
The MF.Net library acts as a translation layer between the Windows, WMF, COM and the C# managed code. 
The names of the function calls are identical and once you get used to how to modify the parameters
of the calls to work with C#, the many and various C++ WMF examples on the Internet become usable.

The Windows WMF system offers numerous sample code projects and the MF.Net library provides C#
translations of these. However, although these sample projects work, they do not seem to be 
especially friendly to people trying to learn WMF for the first time. In general, the Tanta
code is intended to provide a nice linear trajectory through the problem. Sort of a "do this, 
because of this", "do this next, because of that" approach to the issue with as much of the 
extraneous complexity as possible stripped out.  

There is a free online companion book, "Windows Media Foundation - Getting Started in C#" 
which contains a detailed discussion of much of the Tanta Sample code.

The Tanta applications all use, and require, the MF.Net libraries. A few of the Tanta applications
are just simplified (and better commented) versions of the MF.Net samples - the remainder
demonstrate functionality not present in those examples. 

These samples were all written and tested on Windows 10 and Windows 7. Probably they will work on Win8
but this has not been tested. Theoretically, they will work on Vista - but it is not likely.

Some of the Tanta Sample Projects will read and/or write MP3 or MP4 files. Example MP3 and MP4
files are located in the root directory of the Tanta repository. The Tanta Projects will
assume a directory of C:\Dump as the default location of these files. To save yourself some
time you might consider creating that directory and copying the example files there.
