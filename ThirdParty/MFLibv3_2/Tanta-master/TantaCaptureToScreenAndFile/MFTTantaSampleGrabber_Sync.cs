/// This file implements a Synchronous Media Foundation Transform (MFT)
/// which simply passes the input samples to the output. As such it
/// accepts all formats. 
/// 
/// However, the transform also implements "sample grabber" type 
/// functionality - much like the Microsoft supplied SampleGrabber sink.
/// If the sink writer object is present, the transform will 
/// also give the incoming sample out to the sink writer so that it can
/// be written to disk.
/// 
/// There are two modes. In the simplest mode the input sample is simply
/// given to the sink writer. If the user wants to implement a rebasing
/// of the time on the sample (so that the first sample starts at time
/// 0 and every subsequent sample is adjusted off of that) then the 
/// input sample is cloned, the timestamp reset and that cloned sample
/// is given to the sink writer. Note that the rebasing of the timestamp
/// does not seem to be necessary - it probably once was because all of
/// the sample code seems to take particular care to implement this.
/// 
/// In the interests of simplicity, this particular MFT is not designed
/// to be "independent" of the rest of the application. In other words,
/// it will not be placed in an independent assembly (DLL) it will not 
/// be COM visible or registered with MFTRegister so that other applications
/// can use it. This MFT is expected to be instantiated with a standard
/// C# new operator and simply given to the topology as a binary
