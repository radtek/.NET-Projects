#### The TantaTransformPicker Project
####

This project presents a control which can enumerate the transforms on a system
and display various items of information regarding that transform.

1) Present a pick list of all transform category types
2) Interrogate the system and find out which transforms are available.
3) List various items of information regarding each transform.
3) Allow the user to choose the transform for later use in a topology.

Other than demonstrating how to discover transforms on the system, this sample
code does nothing with the transform once it gets selected besides displaying
a bit of information about it.
