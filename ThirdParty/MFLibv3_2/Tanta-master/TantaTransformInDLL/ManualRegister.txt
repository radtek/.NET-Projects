# This file contains the commands to manually configure the DLL in the registry. 
# This is done via the RegAsm.exe utility. The location of the RegAsm.exe file
# varies depending on the .Net version you are using so you will probably have 
# to look for it.

# Note that compiling this solution as Administrator (you need the permissions)
# will automatically run RegAsm.exe for you. If you are manually running the 
# commands below, you will probably need to start your command prompt as 
# administrator

# Note that running RegAsm.exe will also make calls into the dll and execute the 
# contents of the DllRegisterServer and DllUnregisterServer functions in the
# MFTTantaVideoRotator_Sync class. Look at the comments in that section of the 
# source code for more information on why this is done.

# Unregister Transform if it is present
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\regasm C:\Projects\Tanta\TantaTransformInDLL\bin\Debug\MFTTantaVideoRotator_Sync.dll /u 

# Register the Transform
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\regasm C:\Projects\Tanta\TantaTransformInDLL\bin\Debug\MFTTantaVideoRotator_Sync.dll /tlb:MFTTantaVideoRotator_Sync.tlb /codebase
