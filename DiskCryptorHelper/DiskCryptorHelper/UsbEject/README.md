# usbeject
C# code to safely eject removable storage (Windows 8.1, compiled 32-bit)

This is a class library of code stolen from a codeprojects page, and modified to fix a bug where it wasn't ejecting the drive it
claimed to be ejecting. All the copyright headers in it are from the original author. I'm providing this code here since aparently
the codeprojects page is dead (and the code posted there was broken anyways). 

I was running this code on Windows 8.1 Embedded Industrial (64-bit) compiled as a 32-bit dll. I received a pull request from somebody who looked like they knew what they were doing which apparently makes the code compile/work for AnyCPU. I have not tested this.

I'm distributing this software with NO WARRANTY and NO GUARANTEE of suitability for any purpose, etc, etc, yada, yada, don't sue me.

Usage example pulled from my code:

    VolumeDeviceClass volumes = new VolumeDeviceClass();
    foreach (Volume vol in volumes.Devices)
    {
      if (vol.LogicalDrive.Equals(eject_drive))
      {
        eventLog.WriteEntry("Attempting to eject drive: " + cur_write_drive);
        vol.Eject(false);
        eventLog.WriteEntry("Done ejecting drive.");
        break;
      }
    }
